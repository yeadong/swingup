# swingup
:octocat: Swingup - a barebone game :video_game: of the cart-pole swing-up scenario :arrow_up: implemented with pygame :snake:

Swingup is a light weight game based on pygame. The physics are lifted by [pymunk](www.pymunk.org/en/latest/), a 2d physics library which itself is a pythonic wrapper around a C library called [chipmunk](https://chipmunk-physics.net/).


## Installation
Currently, there is no `setup.py` file, which will change in a while.
Until then, simply use pip and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download
and install your dependencies.

## Play and Enjoy
In order to start the game, simply run the `swingup.py` script via `python swingup.py`
